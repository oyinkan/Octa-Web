                                    <p>Spam is unsolicited email sent in bulk. Any promotion, information or solicitation that is sent to a person via e-mail without their prior consent, where there is no pre-existing relationship between the sender and the recipient, is spam.</p>
                                    <p>Examples of Spam<p>

                                        <span>· Any e-mail message that is sent to a recipient without a way for a person to opt-out or request that future mailings not be sent to them, is spam</span>
                                        <span>· Any email message that does not have a valid email address in the From Line is spam.</span>
                                        <span>· Any email message that contains any false or misleading information in the header, subject line or message itself is spam.</span>
                                        <span>· Any email message that promotes an adult web site is spam, unless the recipient has specifically requested information from that web site.</span>
